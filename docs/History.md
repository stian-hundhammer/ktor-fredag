# 1.11.2022 - Starting

Startet setting up the system. The only thin I want to do right now, is first to make something
that build to Docker so it can be deployed. I want to deploy on AWS ECS.

An HelloWorld-ish thing is enough at this time, but I want to add the model 
used in my old system, so that data can be imported ...somehow.
